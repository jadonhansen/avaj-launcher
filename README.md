# avaj-launcher
First Java project - 2nd Year 1st Semester at WeThinkCode

For Running on Mac (Zsh terminal):
`cd src`
`javac -sourcepath @sources.txt`
`java com/avajlauncher/simulator/Simulator scenario.txt`

The sources.txt file has manually been typed due to the terminal not being able to produce it itself.
